              Sola Gratia School was filled with joy and celebration on
              Saturday, March 22, 2025. The school, established in 2008, marked
              its 30th anniversary with the theme “Growing in Faith, Excellence,
              and Service.” The celebration took place from morning until
              afternoon and involved students, teachers, staff, parents, and
              alumni. The event began with a thanksgiving service led by Pastor
              Yohanes Sitorus. In his short sermon, he emphasized the importance
              of gratitude for the school's journey and the need to keep growing
              in love and responsibility as a Christian education community.
              After the service, the cultural parade took place. Students from
              each class represented a region of Indonesia through costumes,
              dances, songs, and cultural presentations. Loud cheers filled the
              schoolyard when the 11th graders performed the Saman dance from
              Aceh energetically and in perfect sync. Melinda, a 10th-grade
              student, shared, “At first I was nervous, but after weeks of
              practice and support from my friends, I gained confidence. It was
              so much fun!” The entertainment stage followed, showcasing musical
              drama, poetry, a teacher choir, and a student band. This was also
              the moment for launching Sola Gratia's digital yearbook, featuring
              the school's milestones over the years.At 09:30 a.m., guests were
              invited to enjoy the food bazaar and student project exhibitions.
              Food stalls managed by parents offered dishes like pempek, gudeg,
              siomay, and traditional cakes. There were also booths displaying
              arts and crafts created by students.During the afternoon session,
              the highlight was the ceremonial cutting of the birthday tumpeng
              by the Principal, Mrs. Maria Lestari, accompanied by student
              representatives and senior teachers. In her speech, she expressed
              her deep gratitude for the school's growth over the past 30
              years.<br /><br />

              “It's not easy to build a strong and character-driven learning
              community. But by God's grace and with everyone's support, we've
              made progress. May Sola Gratia continue to be a light and a
              blessing,” she said to the audience. The event concluded with a
              balloon release and a special performance by alumni from the first
              graduating class, who sang an original song titled “Untukmu, Sola
              Gratia.” The song reflected their fond memories and hopes for the
              school's continued impact. The 30th anniversary celebration was
              not just a commemoration, but also a reflection and inspiration to
              keep growing. Sola Gratia remains committed to providing
              high-quality education, building character, and meeting future
              challenges with a spirit of service.
