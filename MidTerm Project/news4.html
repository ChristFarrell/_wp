              Sola Gratia School once again carved out a valuable moment through
              a campus visit activity held on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. This
              activity involved students in grades XI and XII to get to know the
              world of higher education directly. Taking place at Universitas
              Nasional Nusantara, this visit aims to broaden students' horizons
              regarding college life and various paths to further education
              after graduating from high school. The activity began at 09.00 am
              with a warm welcome by the campus Public Relations team. The
              students were then invited to take a campus tour that included
              visits to the library, laboratory, classrooms, and student
              dormitories. The impression of enthusiasm was clearly seen from
              the faces of the students who actively asked questions and
              documented their experiences. In the question and answer session,
              a student named Rafi asked the campus supervisor, "Is the
              scholarship program here open to students from private schools
              like ours?" This question was immediately greeted with enthusiasm
              by the campus. "Of course. We open equal opportunities for all
              students, both from public and private schools. As long as they
              meet the criteria, everyone can compete fairly," answered Mrs.
              Ratna, the representative for the academic field. <br /><br />The
              visit was also interspersed with a short seminar on choosing a
              major and strategies for successfully entering college. The
              resource person conveyed the importance of knowing one's
              potential, interests, and career prospects before making a choice.
              Mrs. Maria Lestari, Principal of Sola Gratia, stated that this
              campus visit was part of the student self-development program that
              is routinely held every year. "We want students to not only excel
              in their studies, but also be ready to make big decisions in their
              lives. By seeing the campus environment directly, they can imagine
              the future and prepare themselves better," she said. The students
              were also invited to discuss directly with active students from
              various majors. This interaction provided a real picture of
              college life, both from an academic and social perspective. The
              activity ended with a group photo session and the presentation of
              an award plaque from the school to the university as a symbol of
              gratitude. This visit is expected to motivate students to study
              harder and plan their future from an early age. With the spirit of
              learning and exploration, Sola Gratia continues to be committed to
              providing students with relevant, fun, and educational
              experiences.
